### Summary of Article
The main focus of this article is the role of Data Science in the industry of 
one of my favorite hobbies, video games. Specifically, the article explains how
the major players of the industry, such as EA, Sony, Microsoft, etc. have began
to use data to improve the user's experience and engagement with their content. 
Mainly these companies, along with many indie developers, utilize Artificial 
Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Mining techniques to improve both players
and developer enjoyment of games. 

### One "Real World" Application
One, "real-life use case," which the article describes is how machine learning
and AI solve a problematic phenomenon in gaming known as, "Power Boosting." This
is a tactic used frequently in online, multi-player games such as those in the 
Call of Duty series. Essentially, one friend will purposely loose an online
match because there is another friend on the opposing team. This leads to the 
winning player increasing in rank/level even though they really didn't do anything. 
This hurts the skill based matchmaking of most games, so ML models are implemented
to detect which such "virtual crimes" occur. Mainly the variables these models look at
are if the players are friends with each other, but not on the same team repeatedly, and
if player deaths occur at the same location in rapid succession. 

### Ethics of Data Science in Gaming

One aspect which this article doesn't go into which I feel needs to be addressed,
is the ethics behind Data Science in gaming. While many aspects of Data Science
can improve this entertainment industry, such as the previously mentioned instance with preventing
power boosting, there are also many ways which I see big data hurting gaming in general.
One such way is the explosion of cheap, predatory mobile games which have came about 
in recent years. 

![A classic example of cheap mobile game ads](https://static1.thegamerimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mobile-game-scam-promo.jpeg?q=50&fit=contain&w=1140&h=570&dpr=1.5){width=50%}

These games are usually advertised on social media platforms like Instagram, Tiktok,
and many others. The reason these games are "predatory" are because they are teetering
on the line of false advertisement and prey on addictive personalities. These games,
such as in the lefthand section of the photo above, don't actually play as advertised. 
Usually, the advertised game is a mini-game inside a worse quality, ad-packed game, and this
is why false advertising has yet to catch up to these products, just by a loophole. 
In fact, the companies behind these games use the data of players with addictive personalities
to build the games for these adds in the first place. I do believe data science 
does industries good 9 times out of 10, but I think it's also important to look out
for that 1/10 occurence.

### Relevance to My (Hopeful) Career
This article has, at the very least, informed me on how the field of Data Science
has been applied to one of my favorite hobbies. Unfortunately, even though I really
like both Data Science and gaming, I don't think I'll be pursuing a career in game
development as a Data Scientist. For one, the games industry is just under teachers
in terms of unfair working conditions and lack of labor laws. Furthermore, I think that
getting too close to my favorite hobby with my (hopeful) future profession as a 
Software Developer/Data Analyst could perhaps take some of the wide-eyed wonder away.
